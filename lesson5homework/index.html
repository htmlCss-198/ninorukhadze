                <h3>What is personal development?</h3>
                <p>Personal development is looking inward and focusing on ways to better yourself. Personal development increases your self-awareness, your self-esteem, increases your skills, and fulfills your aspirations.Personal development is much larger than just career development or self-development. It encompasses all aspects of your life where you’d like to see personal growth — and it doesn’t discriminate on where it shows up for you.   </p>
                <h3>3 areas of personal development:</h3>
            </div>
                  
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Mental </th>
                    <th>Social </th>
                    <th>Spiritual </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                 <td>Exercising your brain and staying mentally fit is critical to personal development. At BetterUp, this comes to life in a few ways: coaching, learning opportunities, and career growth. For example, right now, I’m taking a creative writing course to help keep my mental creative muscles going strong.</td>
                 <td>Social connections and relationships are also a must-have for any personal development. After all, self-improvement is not a solitary pursuit. Humans are social creatures — we need that connection to learn and grow.
                </td>
               <td>Personal growth and development — whether you’re religious or not — can come through in spirituality. It’s important to recognize that religion and spirituality are not synonymous. In fact, far from it. </td>

             </table>
             <div class="C">
                <h3>How personalized development can help?</h3>
                <p>Personal development is just that: it’s personal. 

                    Every human is different. If our society cracked the nut on personal development, every self-help book would help everyone. Or every learning process would benefit every student. 
                    
                    But we know from our life experiences that there’s no “one-size-fits-all” solution to anything when it comes to human nature. </p>
